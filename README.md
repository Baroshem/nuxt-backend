# Taking Nuxt to the Backend!

This repository is an example project where there are two Nuxt applications:

1. Cat Provider -> Nuxt (Nitro) app that acts as a backend microservice. It connects to Supabase to fetch the data and return it to the user.
2. Cat Consumer -> Nuxt application that fetches the data from Cat Provider to display the data from this REST API to the user.
